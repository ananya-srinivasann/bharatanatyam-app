            <h3>CREATOR, FOUNDER</h3>
            <p>
                Ananya Srinivasan is a student of Samskrithi School of Dance. She has advanced from the basics to mastering complex pieces and reached a significant milestone with her 3-hour solo concert, the Arangetram, in the summer of 2022. Ananya trains extensively and regularly performs at prestigious events like the Cleveland Thyagaraja Aradhana, the largest Indian classical music and dance festival outside India. In addition to her performances, Ananya actively participates in fundraisers, charity events, and competitions.
<br><br>
Ananya also teaches Bharatanatyam to students ranging from young beginners to advanced students, inspiring their passion for dance. Her personalized instruction has led to impressive growth among students, many of whom have successfully prepared for their own Arangetrams and significant dance milestones.
<br><br>
While teaching, she observed that many beginner students struggled to remember steps between classes and lacked guidance for at-home practice. To address this, she developed this app—to help younger dancers practice more effectively and build confidence over time.
