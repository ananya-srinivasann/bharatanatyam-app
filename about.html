                Ananya Srinivasan is a student of Samskrithi School of Dance. She has advanced from the basics to mastering complex pieces and reached a significant milestone with her 3-hour solo concert, the Arangetram, in the summer of 2022. Ananya trains extensively and regularly performs at prestigious events like the Cleveland Thyagaraja Aradhana, the largest Indian classical music and dance festival outside India. In addition to her performances, Ananya actively participates in fundraisers, charity events, and competitions.
<br><br>
Ananya also teaches Bharatanatyam to students ranging from young beginners to advanced students, inspiring their passion for dance. Her personalized instruction has led to impressive growth among students, many of whom have successfully prepared for their own Arangetrams and significant dance milestones.
<br><br>
While teaching, she noticed the struggles beginner students go through while practicing. Although a step was taught in class, it was sometimes forgotten by the next week. The issue was that young students didn't know how to effectively and correctly practice at home. To address this, she set out to build this app-- to guide young dancers' practice sessions and help them grow.
